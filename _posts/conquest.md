He awoke to a silence that hummed with impossible energy. He stood on the sand of a vast, white coliseum, its tiers stretching up into a bleached, featureless sky. The arena was not empty. It was packed with a silent, shimmering multitude. Hundreds, no, thousands of versions of himself.

In one section, a version with ink-stained fingers feverishly wrote in a leather-bound book, the very air around him thick with inspiration. In another, a version of him stood before a cheering boardroom, his suit sharp, his posture radiating wealth. He saw himself on a stage, guitar in hand, bathed in adoration. He saw himself holding a hobby of old, a paintbrush he used to call friend whenever thought couldn't leave him alone. He saw himself in a warm embrace, the face of his wife alight with a love he had long since soured. 

From the heart of this spectral audience, a figure emerged riding a white horse. Upon a steed the color of sun-bleached bone, it trotted onto the sands. A skeletal form, impossibly regal, holding a great, unstrung bow. 

A crown glimmered on its brow, pulsing with a faint, internal light. The being was beaming with ambition, skull full of desire with each trot of his horse. Its hollow eyes fixed upon the lone, failed man in the center of it all.

When it spoke, its voice was the sound of a gavel striking, a deal being sealed, a border being drawn.

"An audience of victories," the White Rider proclaimed, gesturing with its bow to the teeming stands. 

"And here, in the center of it all, the summary of their failures. All that potential, all that fire, distilled into one small vessel of regret. Tell me, little man, how does it feel to be the ghost among your own ghosts?"

The man flinched. The Rider's words gave voice to the crushing weight of the scene. He looked from his own trembling hands to the steady, confident hands of the artist, the businessman, the lover.

"Why?" the man asked, his voice raw. 

"Why am I here, and they are there? We were born of the same mind, the same heart. What cruel trick of fate made them whole and left me in pieces? Did they not face the same unforgiving world? This is not justice. It is a curse!"

A dry, rattling sound came from the White Rider, like stones grinding in a deep cavern. A laugh.

"You cry 'curse' to the heavens, when the flaw is in your own marrow. You see them as separate beings, blessed by a fortune that passed you by. You are wrong. They are not what you could have been. They are what you refused to be. The difference between you and them is not a trick of fate. It is a failure of will. They wanted. You merely wished."

"I did want! I bled for my ambitions! I worked until my fingers were numb and my mind was a fog! But the walls were too high. Hard work is a lie they tell the hopeful. The world is deaf to effort, it only hears the blunder of luck!"

"Walls," The skull mused, tilting its crowned head. 

"You speak of walls as if they were built by others to keep you out. Another lie you tell yourself. You arrived at the walls of others. The walls of kings, of poets, of financiers. And you threw your small body against them, again and again. You exhausted yourself trying to breach a fortress that was never meant for you, because you coveted the prize you saw glittering on its parapets."

The White Rider raised a skeletal hand. 

"You saw their crowns, and you wanted them. The writer's crown of laurels. The banker's crown of gold. You thought conquest was about taking a thing that already existed. That is mere theft. That is the ambition of a child."

"What else is there?" the man asked, his defiance draining away, replaced by a weary confusion. "What other ambition is there, but to succeed as others have?"

"The only one that matters. To forge your own crown. A victory is not a victory if another has claimed it. The ultimate conquest is to set a goal that is yours and yours alone. To build a kingdom in a land no one knew existed. 

Your crown was not meant to be of gold or leaves, but of a material only you could shape. But you left the forge cold. You abandoned your own unique substance to scrabble for the scraps of other men's glories."

The White Rider's gaze swept across the coliseum of silent, successful selves.

"Their success is an accusation because it is theirs. The artist did not try to be the banker. The lover did not try to be the king. They each conquered the only territory worth conquering, the unique landscape of their own soul. You, little man, died a foreigner in your own land, coveting the citizenship of others."

The shimmering figures in the stands seemed to glow brighter, their silent judgment becoming a roar of fulfilled purpose. The man could not bear it. He could not look at the Rider, at its terrible, true crown. He turned, and with a sob caught in his throat, he fled the arena of his own potential, stumbling away from the white light and into a gathering, blood-red gloom.
