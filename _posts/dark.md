You walk under the lamps as if testing skin, the light keeping its distance like a verdict. You tell yourself there was a logic once. Work, schedule, merit. But the city is a ledger that erases receipts.  

You have learned the vocabulary of failure, small combustions of hope with the slow corrosion of plans. You measure your life in steps toward an unshared summit, perhaps someone else takes the final staircase while you stand in the stairwell smelling hollow air. 

Night consolidates around concrete and fog, lampposts indifferent sentinels that outline absence. You clutch a resolve that tastes of rust and a cheap coffee, a flicker, courage or merely obstinacy. You test superstition and calculus, counting negligible causes, imagining a hidden die behind the skyline. You prefer the honesty of ruins to a promised light that chooses. Still you move because inertia is a different surrender and there's no refuge within a romantic ruin.

The pavement will not console, you knew it well. Perhaps too well. It records only small footsteps and silent pressure. Yet still, you proceed with despair, translating losses into a practice of persistence. You accept that the heavens have rules you cannot bribe, but you always step against the night. The road is dark and scary but the only way out is through.
