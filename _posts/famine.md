The frantic noise of battle faded not to silence, but to an oppressive void. He fell, or perhaps merely ceased to move, landing on cracked, barren earth. Overhead, the sky was an unbroken sheet of grey, heavy and suffocating, mirroring the desolation within him. No wind blew, yet a dry, rasping whisper seemed to emanate from the very air, carrying the scent of dust and oblivion.

Here, there were no triumphant versions of himself. No warring factions. Only him. Alone. Utterly, terribly alone.

A gnawing hunger began in his belly, not for food, but for something far deeper. His throat was parched, each breath tasting like ash, yet it was not water his soul craved. An ache settled in his chest, a hollow, echoing chamber where a heart should have been.

“This is it,” a voice whispered in the vast emptiness of his mind. 

“This is the end. The final quiet. After all the striving, all the fighting, all the wanting… nothing. Just this.” 

He waited, but no other thought came. He waited, but no memory rose to comfort him. He waited, but no future sparked a flicker of hope. He was a husk, a forgotten sack of meat, discarded on a forgotten plain. The world outside him was as dead as the world within. He had longed for peace, and now he had it. An utter desolation.

He did not see the Black Rider approach. It simply was there, rising from the grey horizon. Upon a horse the color of midnight, sat a skeletal figure draped in ancient, tattered robes. It was impossibly gaunt, its bones seeming to sing of endless deprivation. 

In one hand, it held a pair of ancient, perfectly balanced scales, each pan empty. Its head was bowed slightly, as if in perpetual contemplation of an insurmountable debt. Its eyes, deep pits of shadow, were fixed on the man.

It did not speak with a voice that vibrated the air, but with words that settled, cold and dry, directly into the man’s mind.

"You have arrived," the Black Rider’s thought resonated, devoid of malice or pity, merely a statement of fact. 

"The place where all roads of want ultimately lead. After the futile chase for a crown that was never yours to claim, after the endless war waged only against yourself, here you are. Empty. What do you seek now, little man? What hunger still stirs in the dust of your soul?"

The man shivered, though there was no cold. 

"I… I don't know," he heard himself think, the words a dull echo. 

"I just want it to stop. The striving, the anger, the feeling... this nothingness."

"The nothingness is your creation. You chased the phantom of Conquest, dreaming of riches you never earned, of accolades you never deserved. And when those shallow wellsprings ran dry, you turned to War, sharpening your envy and resentment into a blade against every perceived rival, every fleeting happiness you saw in another. But the deepest hunger, the most profound void, comes not from what you failed to take, but from what you failed to give."

The Black Rider slowly, deliberately, held up its scales. 

"Behold your balance, little man. In one pan, the aspirations you abandoned, the connections you severed, the affections you refused to nurture. The joy you never shared, the comfort you never offered, the empathy you never extended."

As the Black Rider spoke, the man saw it. The ghosts of his past. A withered bouquet he never gave. A hand he refused to hold. A kind word he withheld, fearing vulnerability. A moment of true presence he traded for bitter rumination. He saw the empty spaces in the lives of those he had pushed away, spaces that he, by his own choosing, had left vacant.

"And in the other pan," 

The Black Rider continued, the thought pressing down on him, "all the things you craved. The love you demanded but never truly gave. The understanding you expected but never offered. The purpose you longed for but refused to forge for yourself. The happiness you wanted others to provide, but for which you prepared no soil."

The scales, though empty, hung in a profound, terrible imbalance. One pan, heavy with all his unspoken wants and withheld affections, plunged downwards, while the other, light with all the self-care and genuine effort he had neglected, floated uselessly upward.

"I… I didn't see it," the man's thought was a moan. 

"I was so busy fighting... so busy wanting what others had... I starved myself. I starved everyone around me. I built a wall of self-pity and hatred, and in the end, I was the one left hollow within it."

"The truth is often the most bitter draught.

You sought to be full, but you drained yourself through every withheld kindness, every unspoken truth, every moment of genuine connection you deemed too risky. You are not empty because the world took from you. You are empty because you refused to nourish yourself, or anyone else, with the simple bread of being truly present. Your depression, your hollowness, these are not misfortunes that befell you. They are the harvest of a life lived in perpetual, self-imposed famine."

The man crumpled to the barren earth, the weight of the Rider's silent judgment crushing him. The hunger in his soul was an agonizing, infinite abyss. He saw the truth of his barren landscape, the ultimate consequence of his choices. There was nowhere left to run from the truth. 

There was nothing left but this profound, aching emptiness. He closed his eyes, welcoming the cold, desolate peace of oblivion, praying for an end to the unbearable hunger.
