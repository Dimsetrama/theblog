I wandered beneath the cathedral of night  
where the sea rehearsed its endless catechism  
and the moon, an impartial witness  
spilled its radiance on the victor’s mast.  

I, too, had labored with unblinking devotion  
dragging my ambition through salt and silence  
believing that sweat was a covenant  
that toil could bribe the indifferent stars.  

But the firmament is not a ledger  
it keeps no record of suffering  
only the cold arithmetic of ascent  
one flame ordained, the other extinguished.  

I, too, sought the sanctum of ambition  
a chamber without echo  
where only one voice can resound.  
I mistook its silence for invitation  
never knowing it was already occupied.  

I, too, hear the shoreline mock me with permanence  
each wave repeating the same ontology of loss  
that effort is ephemeral  
and fate disguises itself as merit.  
The universe rolls its hidden dice  
then calls the outcome destiny.  

I, too, am the second pilgrim  
the one whose shadow outpaces his torch.  
Perhaps only the consolation of obscurity remains  
to linger in the margins of another’s triumph  
to watch the radiance fracture across water  
and know it was never meant to be shared.  

I, too, remain, companion to this nocturne  
half-praying the tide will misplace him  
half-accepting the ancient decree  
that the light never had room for two.
