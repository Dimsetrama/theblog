Imagine Sisyphus actually makes it to the top of the hill. There he is, sweaty, triumphant, rock in place, no rollback. The gods are confused, the myth is ruined, and he’s probably just standing there, thinking, “Well… now what?”

Wouldn’t that be the core of the absurd? A hilarious moment when we realize that even if we win, even if the rock stays, we still have no grand finale waiting for us. There’s no celestial fireworks show nor divine pat on the back. Just silence, a rock, and probably another hill.

Camus saw this absurdity not as a tragedy but as a stage set for freedom. We push the rock because the rock is there. Life hands us repetition, and instead of whining about it, we get to shrug, laugh bitterly, and keep going.

Of course, Camus didn’t have to wake up to alarms at 6 a.m. or reply to 43 unread emails, but still, Sisyphus’s punishment is not so different from our routines.

But have we ever to just stop and think?

When does a routine become discipline? And when does discip line become a mindless redundancy? You wake up early every morning, go for a run, meditate, drink your matcha, go to work or class, share some “hi” and “hello”, other boring conversation to make the day go by, go home and repeat.

Sounds meaningful, right? But is it discipline because it shapes your life? Or redundancy because you’re stuck in a loop society convinced you is “productive”? At what point does counting calories and drinking whey powder stop being a choice and start being your own personal rock?

We live in a world obsessed with metrics. Steps walked, hours worked, texts answered, reps at the gym. Productivity has become a religion, and our prayers are tracked by apps. But metrics don’t measure meaning.

Ten thousand steps may keep you alive, but it won’t tell you whether you lived
Society tends to conflate “busy” with “meaningful,” as though running in circles faster somehow justifies the circle itself.

But here’s where it gets tricky.
That’s where Sisyphus is a kind of mirror. His rock doesn’t get lighter, and the hill doesn’t get smaller. The task doesn’t improve him. The point is not progress. It’s endurance. And yet, Camus imagines him happy.

Not because he fooled himself into thinking the rock was secretly a diamond, but because he saw through the illusion and kept pushing anyway. He created meaning where none existed.

Now, compare that to us

We call our rocks “career paths,” “fitness journeys,” or “personal growth.” Nothing wrong with that, unless we forget that these names are costumes for the same absurd cycle.

A routine can be discipline if it is chosen, if it connects us to our own vision of life. But the moment it’s only done to fit society’s scoreboard, it slides back into redundancy. You’re not training yourself, you’re training for the gods of LinkedIn.

So maybe the key question is not, “Is this routine meaningful?” but rather, “Did I choose it?”

Sisyphus didn’t get to choose his punishment, but he did get to choose his stance toward it. That’s the absurd heroism Camus admired. Likewise, we don’t choose the existence we’re thrown into but we do choose whether our routines enslave us or discipline us.

If Sisyphus reaches the top, maybe he just shrugs, stretches his back, and starts looking for another rock. Not because he’s a masochist, but because he knows the hill is the stage where freedom plays out.

In a sense, so do we. Our alarms ring, the texts pile up, the matcha latte blends. The rock rolls down, and we push again.
