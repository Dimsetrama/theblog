The white, silent light of the coliseum shattered behind him, and he fell forward into mud and chaos. The air, once still and sterile, was now thick with the coppery tang of blood and the guttural roar of unending battle. A sky the color of a fresh wound pulsed overhead, casting a hateful, red gloom on a landscape torn by trenches and pocked by craters.

This was a warzone, endless and horrifying. But the true horror dawned on him as a warrior, face contorted in a scream of rage, charged past him and drove a spear through the back of a fleeing soldier. As the vanquished man fell, his face turned towards the sky. It was his own. The victor let out a triumphant roar and raised his helmet. His face, too, was the man's own.

Everywhere, it was the same. He was the spearman and the slain, the archer and the target, the hero and the coward. He saw a version of himself, young and hopeful, being bludgeoned by one who was older, his face a mask of cynicism. He saw himself strangling himself in a muddy trench. 

This was not an army. This was a soul committing suicide, over and over, for eternity. The noise was the cacophony of every self-recrimination, every bitter internal monologue, every silent scream of frustration he had ever swallowed.

A guttural laugh, sharp as grinding steel, cut through the din.

On a massive, snorting charger the color of dried blood, sat a skeletal figure. It was larger, more brutal than the first Rider. It hefted a colossal greatsword as if it were a twig, its rusted surface stained with millennia of slaughter. Its horned helmet was pitted and scarred, and from its hollow sockets burned a fire of pure, ecstatic malice. It was not a general observing from a distance. It was a berserker who lived for the fray.

"Glorious!" the Red Rider bellowed, its voice a war cry. 

"Yes! This is the only honest place! No pretty lies about crowns or potential here. Only the mud and the blood and the truth of the kill! I have seen your kind wage war for gods, for gold, for glory. But this... a war against the self? This is the purest vintage of hatred!"

The man stumbled back, horrified. "What is this place? Who are you?"

"This is the engine that drove you!" the Red Rider roared with delight. 

"And I am its name! Conquest gave you an arrow, but you were too afraid to aim it at the world. So you turned it inward. Tell me, little warrior, who is the enemy today? Is it the colleague who stole your promotion? The friend whose happiness felt like a personal insult? Is it the man who now sleeps beside the woman who swore she loved you?"

The Red Rider's words stoked the embers of the man's rage. The familiar, bitter litany of his life's injustices boiled to the surface. 

"They were!" he screamed over the clamor of the battle.  

"They held me down! They mocked me with their easy victories! If they had only failed, just once, I could have breathed! They are the reason for this!"

The Skull on the red steed threw its head back and laughed, a sound of pure, terrible joy.

"Hypocrite!" it howled. 

"Oh, you are a wonderful hypocrite! You paint their faces on your banners and name them your great enemy. You sharpen your resentment in the dead of night and dream of their downfall. But what did you ever do? Did you ever face them? Did you ever risk the true battle? No! You were a coward!"

The Red Rider pointed its greatsword at the ongoing, fratricidal slaughter.  

"You raged at them in the safety of your own skull, but the only war you ever had the courage to fight was against yourself! You see this grand battle? This is your courage! The courage to hate yourself, to sabotage your every advance, to be your own most dedicated and vicious assassin!"

"No," the man choked out, the word a pathetic defense. "I hated them..."

"You needed them!" the figure corrected, its voice dropping to a low, vicious growl. 

"You needed their success to justify your own bitterness. You needed an enemy you could never defeat to excuse you from ever truly fighting. 

They were the fuel, little man, but the fire was always your own self-hatred. You looked in the mirror and you despised what you saw, so you pretended the mirror was a window, and that the monster was on the other side."

The Red Rider leaned down, the burning malice in its eyes seeming to sear the man's soul. 

"But there is no one on the other side. There is only you. There has only ever been you."

The sounds of the battle intensified, the screams and clashes of steel now unbearably intimate. Each cry was a memory of a time he had talked himself out of trying. Each clang of a sword was an echo of a venomous, self-loathing thought. He had thought Conquest's silent judgment was hell. 

He was wrong. This war, this chorus of his own fury, was infinitely worse. He clapped his hands over his ears, turned his back on the laughing Red Rider, and fled. He ran from the noise, desperate for silence, for an end to the war, for a final, hollow peace.
