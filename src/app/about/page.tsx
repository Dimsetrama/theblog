                There are people who are born with names that sound like prophecies, but a name that basically translates into “young victorious sun” sounds hell of a heavy burden, isn’t it?
                Imagine being named after the eternal source of light, then spending your twenties arguing with yourself about whether matcha tastes like grass.

                He is the kind of person who takes the tragicomedy of life very seriously. When he cuts down his body fat, it’s not just about looking sharper in the mirror; it’s about slicing away the unnecessary illusions of comfort, burning them off like calories.
                The prick who will train to failure and then write an autistic caption about failure like it was preordained by the gods of schizophrenic anarchist. If Camus told us to imagine Sisyphus happy, this guy would probably reply, "Sisyphus would post gym pics too."

                The gym is nothing more than a cathedral of overcompensation, iron plates clanging like church bells announcing the gospel of inadequacy. 
                Every rep is less about muscle and more about masking the invisible fractures of his life, bench-pressing the weight of unmet expectations and unreached childhood dreams.

                Call it therapy, call it vanity, call it a ritual of pretending that biceps can substitute for emotional stability.

                And then there's the matter of faith, or the absence of it. That guy, in a way, is devout in his atheism. Rationality is practically his version of a substitute, a place where one stops and thinks, "Should we really bow to Him?".
                If he is proven wrong, however, if a Creator exists, he'll shrug and say that perhaps no one ever considers the possibility that maybe God doesn't believe in us.

                But maybe that's the beauty of it. For all the laughter and undiagnosed autism, he is still profoundly human.
                Doubts, desires, and delusions. Plays hard games with harder lives, still looking for the small victories. His curse isn't that he doesn't
                believe in God, it's that he still believes in people, against better judgment.
